# Task 4 – General Health Query Chatbot (LLM-Based)

## Overview
This project implements a **general health query chatbot** using a **Large Language Model (LLM)**.  
The chatbot provides **friendly, clear, and safe responses** to basic health-related questions while avoiding harmful or misleading medical advice.

The system uses **prompt engineering** and **safety-aware design** to ensure responsible AI behavior.

---

## Objective
The main goals of this project are:

- Use an LLM to answer general health-related questions  
- Apply **prompt engineering** to control tone and behavior  
- Implement **safety handling** to avoid harmful medical advice  
- Demonstrate **responsible AI usage** in healthcare-related applications  

---

## Model Used
**Mistral-7B-Instruct** (Open Source LLM)

This is a pre-trained, instruction-tuned language model designed for conversational AI tasks.  
No training or fine-tuning was required for this task.

---

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Hugging Face Transformers  
- PyTorch  
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## How It Works
The chatbot uses a prompt template that instructs the model to behave like a helpful and responsible medical assistant.  
It avoids:
- Prescribing medicine  
- Giving exact dosages  
- Making medical diagnoses  

Instead, it focuses on providing **general health information** in a friendly and non-alarming way.

---

## Dataset and Training
No dataset or training process was required for this task.  
A pre-trained Large Language Model (**Mistral-7B-Instruct**) was used directly.

The focus of this project is on:
- Prompt engineering  
- Safety handling  
- Responsible AI usage  

---

## Key Results and Insights
- Prompt engineering successfully controls the chatbot’s tone and behavior  
- Safety-focused design helps prevent harmful medical advice  
- Open-source LLMs can be used to build practical and ethical AI applications  
- The chatbot is suitable for **educational and awareness-based health guidance**
